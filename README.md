To run my application use the command npm install and npm start. After running my application on localhost:3000 you can see some fitness items being displayed on the screen By pressing add to cart button to any item you can see that it adds a number after the button, that is the quantity of the items, everytime you click one more quantity is going to be added. After you add as many items ass you want you can go to the burger menu on the top left and is going to display a shopping cart icon, you can click the shopping cart and you will be redirected to the cart page, where you can see the product you have selected. You have some funcionality in that page too, see the quantity under the item and the two buttons "-" and "+" if you click one of those you will change the quantity of that product accordingly to the button you click. Down in that page you have two other buttons: "Continue shopping" and "Checkout". If you click Continue Shopping you will be redirected to the shop page. If you click the Checkout button you will be redirected to the Checkout page. In the Checkout page you have your total cost of products and two buttons "Continue Shopping" with the same funcionality as its mentioned above and the "Confirm" button that has no functionality at all.
